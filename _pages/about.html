<h1>About</h1>

<p>This project utilises GitHub pages functionality to create a simple single page application (SPA) that can convert markdown files to HTML format on the fly.</p>
<br><br>
<p>The posts are written in a <em>/_posts</em> subfolder in markdown and added to <em>/_posts/posts.json</em> when they are ready to be published. Then they automatically appear in the posts link and loaded through XHR requests without extra page reloads.</p>
